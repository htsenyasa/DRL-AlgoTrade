This file includes the description of how to name source files based on their context.

All source files must have a prefix based on their context such xx_SourceFileName.ext where xx_ prefix highlights the context of the source file.

Two pieces of codes that are implemented on different contexts must be separated.

Only main files or non-executable files may not have a prefix

List of Prefixes and Contexts:

ai  -> (Artificial Intelligence)    -> Neural Network/Artificial Intelligence.
tf  -> (Trading Framework)          -> Any piece of code that realizes trading or related activity.
cm  -> (Common)                     -> Common files which may be used for in all contexts such as parsing operations.
