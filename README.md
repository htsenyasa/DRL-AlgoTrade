to algorithmic tranining" (Theate & Ernst, 2021) in pytorch for educational purposes.


To run the code:

Install necessary modules with "env2/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"

To generate APPL results run mainAAPL.py
To generate ISCTR results run mainISCTR.py

To generate both of them simultaneously, you may use mainMultiprocess.py
